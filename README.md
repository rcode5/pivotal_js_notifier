# Pivotal Notifier - Chrome Extension

This simple extension watches your Pivotal project page.  When you start a story, it puts up a reminder message with the title of the story (so you know what you should be working on) and the important message "do not panic".  

This extension can be used to keep your anxiety in check if you happen to be an over-thinker, or if you're on a project with unrealistic goals or just a tight timeline.  

Keep coding fun!

## Installing
